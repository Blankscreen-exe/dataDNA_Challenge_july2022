They gave us a **Pokemon dataset** our objective was to bring forth a **dream team** of 6 pokemons with 2 condition:

> 1. A Team which will deal the **most damage**.
> 2. A Team which will **remain relatively impervious** to any other team of 6 fully trained pokemons

Although the first condition was easy, the latter was tough and gave me a hard time figuring out the type balancing. But here I am with my **DataVisualization** made in **PowerBI**. You can take a look at the dataset [here on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kartikkadian/pokemondata).
